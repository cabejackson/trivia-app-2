# Trivia App Client

This app allows users to play a trivia game!
Playing games also encourages users to take a break away from their everyday stressors!

Here's the deployed version of `Trivia App`: [Trivia App](https://trivia-rose.vercel.app/)

## Storytime

Finding creative ways to learn new things has been a goal of mine this year!

This app can help users learn fun facts by challenging them to answer a series of random questions.

Some things I'm particularly proud of within this app include:

- use of React Hooks
- implementation of smoke tests
- implementation of React Router (link, switch, route)
- creating a custom 404 not Found Page
- following A11Y checklist

Fun tidbit:
I learned a lot about background image positioning and accessibility concerns while developing this app!
